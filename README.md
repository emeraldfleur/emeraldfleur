Hello! On my repo I've got three things of note I've been working on since starting this account.

A) Helped fix the dark mode on the iOS (Swift) version of the open source Beeminder app, and contributed a couple of issues relating to failures discovered while using the product.

B) I imported a repo from Revature to work on coding problems. This constitues the majority of commits on my account.

C) Some other open source issue commits. I'm most interested in Beeminder stuff.
